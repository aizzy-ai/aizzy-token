# Aizzy Token :: $AIZ

## Decentralized AI

Aizzy.ai is a decentralized AI ecosystem powered by the $AIZ Utility token built on the BASE blockchain, enabling seamless peer-to-peer exchanges between AI Model creators, Agent builders, and users. The platform supports a globally accessible, open environment for AI users, builders, and model training. It operates on a permissionless basis with a focus on data sovereignty, training, and output security. These docs outline the ecosystem's features, benefits, and development roadmap.

NB: Aizzy.ai currently operates as a centralized AI platform with a user base in the hundreds of thousands, that is moving to a decentralized model to ensure an open and fair future for AI.

## $AIZ Token Utility

Comprehensive breakdown of the AIZ token utility.

The native and cryptographically-secure, protocol utility token of the Aizzy.ai Ecosystem is the transferrable representation of attributed value within the ecosystem (ticker - $AIZ).

## Built on BASE

Base is built to be the onchain home for Coinbase products, users, and assets, as well as an open ecosystem where anyone can build for them, and easily reach the user base of Coinbase. We believe that AI will revolutionize how people create, build and work, and that the future of AI should be open and globally accessible. Coinbase is bringing the early majority to the world of Web3, and by building on Base we believe we are positioned to reach this majority and bring them to a fair and open world of AI.

Base is a secure, low-cost, builder-friendly Ethereum L2 built to bring the next billion users onchain.

## The Utility of $AIZ

The $AIZ token represents the transferrable, fair value exchange within the Aizzy.ai ecosystem. Holders of AIZ get access to several unique benefits within the ecosystem:

### AI Users + Community

### Builders

- List Agents on the Aizzy.ai ecosystem using AIZ, and earn revenue when your agents are utilized by our community. Builders will pay all listing fees in AIZ, and earn all protocol revenue in AIZ.
- Access advanced models and API features for your Agents using the AIZ token.
- AI Model Operators
- List your Models on the Aizzy.ai Ecosystem and earn revenue from their usage by popular AI Agents on the Protocol. Operators will pay all listing fees in AIZ, and earn all revenue in AIZ.
- Access unique training data sets provided by the community, or train your models on real human users within the platform.

The $AIZ utility token represents the transfer of fair value in the Aizzy.ai ecosystem, rewarding participants and providers of value to our community as they revolutionize their creative endeavors, businesses and study.

# $AIZ Token Supply
A comprehensive breakdown of the AIZ token supply, emissions and distribution.

> Fixed Total Supply: 1,000,000,000

The Supply of AIZ is fixed. Once the total Supply of 1,000,000,000 AIZ tokens have been minted, no more tokens will be introduced to the supply.
AIZ Token Supply Allocation

**AIZ Token Allocation**

> 72% of total Supply is allocated to the community, ensuring a truly
> decentralized and fair AI Ecosystem.

Categories and Descriptions

The Categories of Token Allocation are described below. For a full breakdown of allocation, distribution and emissions schedule see the google sheet below:

Allocation and Emissions Google Sheet:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MzOqdcNtpwYiLV43rYT8_E_JtLXm7O5Q4wXeb8c5nis/edit?usp=sharing

**Public Sale**

The public sale represents the initial launch of the AIZ Utility Token to the public. The sale will be conducted in stages as per below:

- Stage 1: $0.08 USD per AIZ
- Stage 2: $0.09 USD per AIZ
- Stage 3: $0.10 USD per AIZ
- Stage 4: $0.11 USD per AIZ

> Public Sale Total Supply = 10% (100 million AIZ)

**Initial Liquidity Pool**

These tokens will be used to fund the initial liquidity pool to allow for the trading of AIZ on well known AMMs. The ILP allocation will be available immediately from vesting to allow for deep markets immediately.

>- Initial Liquidity Pool = 2% (20 million AIZ)
>- Vesting = Immediately Available at TGE

**Rewards Pool**

The Rewards Pool represents the protocols emmissions as part of ongoing user incentives, driving growth and usage amongst the users of aizzy.ai ecosystem, it's agents and AI Models. This will ensure that the community is incentivized for usage of the platform, and ensure early users are rewarded as a vital part of our community.

The rewards pool will fund customer engagement through programs such as Cashback rewards, competitions and community engagement.

>- Rewards Pool = 5% (50 million AIZ)
>- Vesting = Linear over 4 years (48 Months)

**Operations Treasury**

The operations treasury is an innovative treasury, that allows for the distribution of AIZ tokens collected by the platform from users of AI Agents to the participants providing value to the ecosystem. Every Epoch it distributes the AIZ revenue to Agent Builders, Model Operators, Ecosystem Partners and the Platform prorated to their use by the community over the previous epoch.

The Operations Treasury will be constantly re-filled from users of the platform purchasing value and AI Agent use. The initial Supply form the allocation provides added incentive for early providers of utility to the platform.

For more details on how the Operations Treasury operate see: $AIZ Ecosystem

>- Operations Treasury = 5% (50 million AIZ)
>- Vesting = 1 year linearly from launch of Builder Marketplace (12 months)

**Operator Rewards Pool**

The Operator Rewards Pool rewards Model Operators for providing AI Models for use by the Agent Builders. We consider Model Operators as utility providers to the platform, as opposed to products purchased by our users. As such the Operator Rewards Treasury incentivizes these participants with steady revenue over the long term. The Operator Rewards Treasury will be topped up from the Operations Treasury but to a lesser degree than the Builders Reward Pool.

For more details on how the Operator Rewards Pool operates in the larger ecosystem see: $AIZ Ecosystem

>- Operator Rewards Pool = 5% (50 million AIZ)
>- Vesting = 4.5 years linear from the launch of Builder Marketplace (54 months)

**Growth + Marketing**

Tokens have been allocated to the growth of the platform, providing the protocol  with a fund to use to incentivize growth, and partnerships and build out the ecosystem beyond the initial platform. The community will have the chance to participate in the decision-making for the allocation of these tokens.

>- Growth + Marketing = 10% (100 million)
>- Vesting = 2.5% (25 million) immediately, 7.5% linearly over 4 years

**Community Treasury**

The Community Treasury represents the future funding and investment in the community and protocol separate from those allocations already provided for. The community will have the opportunity to participate in the decisions for how the Community Treasury is allocated and distributed. 

The Protocol Treasury functions as a strategic reserve to be deployed across a variety of uses, including but not limited to:

- Operational Costs
- Opportunistic Fundraising
- Ongoing Costs
- Partnership opportunities
- Reward Pool Allocations

>- Community Treasury = 25% (250 million AIZ)
>- Vesting = Linear over 5 years (60 months)

**Staking Rewards Pool**

The Staking Rewards Pool funds the staking rewards to the community who stake the AIZ token to secure the network, validate models and agent listings, and any other validation requirements of the Protocol or Ecosystem.

The Staking rewards are released at the end of each epoch based on the staking of tokens during the prior epoch.

>- Staking Rewards Pool = 10% (10 million AIZ)
>- Vesting = Linearly over 4.5 years from the launch of the staking protocol (54 months)

**Investors and Advisors**

This allocation represents the tokens held aside for early investors in the Aizzy.ai Ecosystem, as well as advisors that may be brought on to assist in the growth and development of the Protocol. All funds raised from these token sales will be invested in the development of the protocol and ecosystem.

>- Investors and Advisors = 10% (10 million AIZ)
>- Vesting = Linear over 2 years from investment (24 months)

**Founding Team**

The Founding Team allocation represents the core Aizzy.ai team's holdings of AIZ, incentivizing them to maintain, develop, and grow the Aizzy.ai ecosystem. 

>- Founding Team = 18% (180 million AIZ) 
>- Vesting = Linear over 2 years (24 months)

**Emissions Schedule**

The AIZ Token will distribute 100% of the AIZ Supply over 5 years, the schedule can be seen in the Google Sheet below, with a representative graph also provided:
