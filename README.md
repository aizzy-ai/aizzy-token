# <a id="supply"></a>$AIZ Token Supply
A comprehensive breakdown of the AIZ token supply, emissions and distribution.

> Fixed Total Supply: 1,000,000,000

The Supply of AIZ is fixed. Once the total Supply of 1,000,000,000 AIZ tokens have been minted, no more tokens will be introduced to the supply.
AIZ Token Supply Allocation

**AIZ Token Allocation**

> 72% of total Supply is allocated to the community, ensuring a truly
> decentralized and fair AI Ecosystem.

Categories and Descriptions

The Categories of Token Allocation are described below. For a full breakdown of allocation, distribution and emissions schedule see the google sheet below:

Allocation and Emissions Google Sheet:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MzOqdcNtpwYiLV43rYT8_E_JtLXm7O5Q4wXeb8c5nis/edit?usp=sharing

**Public Sale**

The public sale represents the initial launch of the AIZ Utility Token to the public. The sale will be conducted in stages as per below:

- Stage 1: $0.08 USD per AIZ
- Stage 2: $0.09 USD per AIZ
- Stage 3: $0.10 USD per AIZ
- Stage 4: $0.11 USD per AIZ

> Public Sale Total Supply = 10% (100 million AIZ)

**Initial Liquidity Pool**

These tokens will be used to fund the initial liquidity pool to allow for the trading of AIZ on well known AMMs. The ILP allocation will be available immediately from vesting to allow for deep markets immediately.

>- Initial Liquidity Pool = 2% (20 million AIZ)
>- Vesting = Immediately Available at TGE

**Rewards Pool**

The Rewards Pool represents the protocols emmissions as part of ongoing user incentives, driving growth and usage amongst the users of aizzy.ai ecosystem, it's agents and AI Models. This will ensure that the community is incentivized for usage of the platform, and ensure early users are rewarded as a vital part of our community.

The rewards pool will fund customer engagement through programs such as Cashback rewards, competitions and community engagement.

>- Rewards Pool = 5% (50 million AIZ)
>- Vesting = Linear over 4 years (48 Months)

**Operations Treasury**

The operations treasury is an innovative treasury, that allows for the distribution of AIZ tokens collected by the platform from users of AI Agents to the participants providing value to the ecosystem. Every Epoch it distributes the AIZ revenue to Agent Builders, Model Operators, Ecosystem Partners and the Platform prorated to their use by the community over the previous epoch.

The Operations Treasury will be constantly re-filled from users of the platform purchasing value and AI Agent use. The initial Supply form the allocation provides added incentive for early providers of utility to the platform.

For more details on how the Operations Treasury operate see: $AIZ Ecosystem

>- Operations Treasury = 5% (50 million AIZ)
>- Vesting = 1 year linearly from launch of Builder Marketplace (12 months)

**Operator Rewards Pool**

The Operator Rewards Pool rewards Model Operators for providing AI Models for use by the Agent Builders. We consider Model Operators as utility providers to the platform, as opposed to products purchased by our users. As such the Operator Rewards Treasury incentivizes these participants with steady revenue over the long term. The Operator Rewards Treasury will be topped up from the Operations Treasury but to a lesser degree than the Builders Reward Pool.

For more details on how the Operator Rewards Pool operates in the larger ecosystem see: $AIZ Ecosystem

>- Operator Rewards Pool = 5% (50 million AIZ)
>- Vesting = 4.5 years linear from the launch of Builder Marketplace (54 months)

**Growth + Marketing**

Tokens have been allocated to the growth of the platform, providing the protocol  with a fund to use to incentivize growth, and partnerships and build out the ecosystem beyond the initial platform. The community will have the chance to participate in the decision-making for the allocation of these tokens.

>- Growth + Marketing = 10% (100 million)
>- Vesting = 2.5% (25 million) immediately, 7.5% linearly over 4 years

**Community Treasury**

The Community Treasury represents the future funding and investment in the community and protocol separate from those allocations already provided for. The community will have the opportunity to participate in the decisions for how the Community Treasury is allocated and distributed. 

The Protocol Treasury functions as a strategic reserve to be deployed across a variety of uses, including but not limited to:

- Operational Costs
- Opportunistic Fundraising
- Ongoing Costs
- Partnership opportunities
- Reward Pool Allocations

>- Community Treasury = 25% (250 million AIZ)
>- Vesting = Linear over 5 years (60 months)

**Staking Rewards Pool**

The Staking Rewards Pool funds the staking rewards to the community who stake the AIZ token to secure the network, validate models and agent listings, and any other validation requirements of the Protocol or Ecosystem.

The Staking rewards are released at the end of each epoch based on the staking of tokens during the prior epoch.

>- Staking Rewards Pool = 10% (10 million AIZ)
>- Vesting = Linearly over 4.5 years from the launch of the staking protocol (54 months)

**Investors and Advisors**

This allocation represents the tokens held aside for early investors in the Aizzy.ai Ecosystem, as well as advisors that may be brought on to assist in the growth and development of the Protocol. All funds raised from these token sales will be invested in the development of the protocol and ecosystem.

>- Investors and Advisors = 10% (10 million AIZ)
>- Vesting = Linear over 2 years from investment (24 months)

**Founding Team**

The Founding Team allocation represents the core Aizzy.ai team's holdings of AIZ, incentivizing them to maintain, develop, and grow the Aizzy.ai ecosystem. 

>- Founding Team = 18% (180 million AIZ) 
>- Vesting = Linear over 2 years (24 months)

**Emissions Schedule**

The AIZ Token will distribute 100% of the AIZ Supply over 5 years, the schedule can be seen in the Google Sheet below, with a representative graph also provided:

# <a id="ecosystem"></a>$AIZ Ecosystem

A comprehensive breakdown of the mechanics that drive the fair and decentralized exchange of value in the Aizzy.ai Ecosystem.

![enter image description here](https://aizzyai.s3.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/image.webp)

## Why AIZ Ecosystem

The careful allocation, effective supply management, and innovative economic structure of AIZ tokens not only fuel the ecosystem, but also provide incentives for all participants, including creators, developers, and model operators, to shape a fair and forward-thinking AI economy.

We believe that AI should be open and accessible to all. The AIZ Ecosystem fairly rewards participation and value add to the ecosystem.

**Permissionless AI Creation -** Open and accessible AI marketplace for users to find the best AI Agents, using the most advanced models, to enhance their creative endeavors, business and study

**Fair Value Exchange -** One group should not capture all the value of human x AI creativity. The Aizzy.ai Ecosystem fairly rewards providers of AI Models and Builders of AI use cases (Agents).

**Security and Transparency -** Committed to enhancing security and data sovereignty from training data to AI output.

### The Basics - A Fair Value Exchange

The Aizzy.ai Ecosystem has been designed to provide a fair exchange of value in a cryptographically decentralized and fair manner.

Users of utility, such as our >250k users, pay for the use of Aizzy.ai in AIZ Token.

Providers of utility, such as AI Model Operators, AI Agent Builders and the Platform, are rewarded in AIZ.

Because Aizzy.ai is a live product providing hundreds of thousands of users with value, the AIZ token is not just a reward token, but a utility token powering a circular economy. Constant revenue in the form of AIZ from users is distributed to value providers who can then sell the token back to current and future users.

### Operations Treasury

> An innovative and revolutionary blockchain treasury that distributes AIZ fairly to each participant in the AIZ Ecosystem

The Operations Treasury is a unique and innovative application of a Protocol Treasury, created to **fairly distribute the value captured from users** of the Aizzy.ai platform to the providers of value to those users.

All AIZ Revenue is collected in the Operations Treasury every Epoch. The collected AIZ Tokens are then distributed to the specific rewards pools for each contributor of value to the ecosystem.

The % split of distribution will be managed initially by the Aizzy.ai platform to ensure the right incventives are at work. The AIZ Community will have the option to participate in the setting of this distribution.

A portion if the collected AIZ each epoch will be sent to a burn address, ensuring there is **deflationary pressure on the AIZ token**.

### Builders Reward Pools

The **Builders Reward Pool**  is designed to distribute AIZ to the builders of AI Agents on the Aizzy.ai ecosystem. The Reward Pool will have an initial allocation of 5% of total supply, released linearly over the first year from the marketplace launch, to highly incentivize early adopters of the builder marketplace.

We consider the AI Agent Builders as the builders of the Product used by our Aizzy.ai customers, and they should be primarily rewarded from the revenue generated from customers by their Agents. As such the Builder Reward Pool is a primary beneficiary from the Operators Reward Pool.

The entirety of AIZ Revenue sent to the Builders Reward Pool from the Operations Treasury (plus any vested form the initial supply) is distributed at the end of every epoch. The amount distributed to each builder is pro-rated to the use of their agents by the community.

For details see diagram under [The Ecosystem](https://aizzy-ai.gitbook.io/aizzy.ai-docs/community-and-tokenomics/usdaiz-ecosystem#the-ecosystem) and [Operations Treasury](https://aizzy-ai.gitbook.io/aizzy.ai-docs/community-and-tokenomics/usdaiz-ecosystem#operations-treasury)

### Operator Reward Pool

The **Operators Reward Pool**  is designed to distribute AIZ to the providers of AI Models to the Aizzy Ecosystem. The Reward Pool will have an initial allocation of 5% of total supply, released linearly over 4.5 years from the marketplace launch to provide a steady incentive to Model Operators.

We consider the providers of the Models to be a vital utility provider to the Agent Builders and the ecosystem, and should be rewarded from the revenue generated by the Builders on the ecosystem that use their models. As such the Operator Rewards pool is a beneficiary of the Operations Treasury.

In contrast to the Builders Reward Pool, the AIZ in the Operators Reward Pool is distributed more evenly, as a % of the total in the rewards pool each epoch. This is to ensure the Ai model operators who have fixed costs, have a more steady and reliable form of incentive. The amount distributed to each Operator is pro-rated to the number of calls made by agents to their model.

For details see diagram under [The Ecosystem](https://aizzy-ai.gitbook.io/aizzy.ai-docs/community-and-tokenomics/usdaiz-ecosystem#the-ecosystem) and [Operations Treasury](https://aizzy-ai.gitbook.io/aizzy.ai-docs/community-and-tokenomics/usdaiz-ecosystem#operations-treasury)

### Fiat Operations

![](https://aizzy-ai.gitbook.io/~gitbook/image?url=https:%2F%2F691168082-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FHedsBS4QB5oRbOf4Fhe1%252Fuploads%252FjymuHRqdCS90FqrJTGVN%252FFiat%2520Operations_V2.0.png%3Falt=media%26token=a203251c-02e8-40bf-a783-9c83eb88eb82&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=8f4f1556565312e527b30a9e1497436d9a22034cfc351fe4561fca80385bdaf7)

Aizzy.ai's mission is to make AI access universally accessible, and we currently have significant user base that pays in fiat using their local payment methods. As such we will maintain the ability to access Aizzy.ai using fiat to keep the platform as accessible as possible, and ensure a steady stream of fiat revenue into the ecosystem. There are several options for this revenue, that will evolve as Aizzy.ai evolves into a fully decentralized organization.

-   Running and development cost reimbursement to the Platform Provider to reduce reliance on selling treasury and decreasing sell pressure on AIZ.
    
-   Purchasing AIZ on the open market, creating buy side pressure and:
    
    -   Distributing AIZ to the Fiat users to provide a self funded cashback rewards program. Incentivizing growht of community and increased distributed ownership of AIZ.
        
    -   Sending AIZ to the Operations Treasury for distribution.
        
    -   Sending AIZ to replenish Community Treasury.
        
    -   Sending to a Burn Address providing deflationary pressure to the AIZ token.
        
    

### The Ecosystem

A circular ecosystem that provides fair value exchange from users to providers of utility, powering open and globally accessible AI.
